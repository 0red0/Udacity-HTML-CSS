    <h4>STEPS</h4>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Scramble some eggs in tiny bit of oil or butter. Remove them from the pan and set aside on a plate or in a bowl.
            <li>Add a bit more oil or butter to the skillet and saute some onions. I like to keep my onions diced pretty small
                 so my kids don’t have to pick them out, because they can’t even see them. Let the onions cook until they’re
                  soft; about 3 minutes.
            <li>Add some thawed frozen veggies and some minced garlic to the pan. Heck you could even toss them in frozen.
                 I add some butter at this point because it helps to flavor the veggies. You could easily swap the frozen
                  for fresh, or add things like bok choy, broccoli or bean sprouts.
            <li>Add cold rice to the skillet and stir it with a flat wood spatula.
            <li>Once the rice is heated through you can add soy sauce and sesame seeds until you love the flavor, then serve right away.
        </ol>
