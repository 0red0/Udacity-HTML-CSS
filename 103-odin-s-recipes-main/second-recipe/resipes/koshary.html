    <h1>THE EGYPTIAN DISH KOSHARY</h1>

    <p>Koshari (also spelled, Kushari) is the national dish of my birthplace, Egypt. By far one of my favorite things to eat--EVER! No matter how far I've traveled, I will always crave a humble bowl of koshari as served in the streets of Egypt.</p>

    <p>
        What is Koshari?

Koshri is another one of those genius solutions to using up pantry staples. It is a cousin to the Middle Eastern Mujadara. In a nutshell, it is a comforting bowl of simple pantry staples: spiced lentils and rice, combined with chickpeas and small pasta.  All smothered in a tomato sauce that's been spiked with vinegar (out-of-this-world tasty, by the way!) Then...wait for it...it's topped with savory, crispy thin fried onion rings.

    <h2>Ingredients:-</h2>
    <ul>
        
        <li>1 ½ cup brown lentils, picked over and well-rinsed
        <li>1 ½ cup medium-grain rice, rinsed, soaked in water for 15 minutes, drained
        <li>½ tsp each salt and pepper
        <li>½ tsp coriander
        <li>2 cups elbow pasta
        <li>Cooking oil
        <li>Water
        <li>1 15-oz can chickpeas, rinsed, drained and warmed
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:-</h2>
    <ol>
        
        <li>Cook the lentils. Bring lentils and 4 cups of water to a boil in a medium pot or saucepan over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and cook until lentils are just tender (15-17 minutes). Drain from water and season with a little salt. (Note: when the lentils are ready, they should not be fully cooked. They should be only par-cooked and still have a bite to them as they need to finish cooking with the rice).
        <li>Now, for the rice. Drain the rice from its soaking water. Combine the par-cooked lentils and the rice in the saucepan over medium-high heat with 1 tablespoon cooking oil, salt, pepper, and coriander. Cook for 3 minutes, stirring regularly. Add warm water to cover the rice and lentil mixture by about 1 ½ inches (you'll probably use about 3 cups of water here). Bring to a boil; the water should reduce a bit. Now cover and cook until all the liquid has been absorbed and both the rice and lentils are well cooked through (about 20 minutes).  Keep covered and undisturbed for 5 minutes or so.
        <li>Now make the pasta. While the rice and lentils are cooking, make the pasta according to package instructions by adding the elbow pasta to boiling water with a dash of salt and a little oil. Cook until the pasta is al dente. Drain.
        <li>Cover the chickpeas and warm in the microwave briefly before serving.
