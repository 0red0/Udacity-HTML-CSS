HTML elements review 2
Now you've learned about many more HTML elements! This page is a summary of all the elements you've seen so far. You can use this page as a reference if you forget how to use one of these elements in your code.

Block elements
Block elements are used for large sections of text, such as paragraphs, headlines, or lists; and also for some other features such as video players and tables.

A block element creates a (usually invisible) box in the browser display. By default, this box takes up the full width of the display. The beginning of a block always starts on a new line in the display.

Most block elements have a particular way they are displayed by default: paragraphs have margins around them; lists have bullet-points or numbered items; headlines are printed in large text. There is also a generic block element, div, which has no special defaults.

p — Paragraph.
Text in a paragraph is separated visually from other paragraphs by a small margin.
ul and ol — Unordered and ordered lists.
By default, ul lists are displayed with bullet points, and ol lists with numbered items.
li — List items inside a ul or ol list.
The li element has to be nested inside a ul or ol list; it can't occur on its own.
Section headers, from h1 (largest) to h6 (smallest).
Used for headlines, section titles, and the like.
div — A logical division of a page or document.
Other block elements such as paragraphs, lists, and headers can be nested inside a div.
You will see the div element much more in the next lesson. Because they don't have any default display settings, divs are heavily used with custom styling with CSS.

Inline elements
Inline elements do not create a full-width box on the display. They modify the display of text, or insert other things into the text — such as line breaks, images, or hyperlinks.

em and strong — Emphasis.
By default, text inside an em is displayed as italic, and text in strong is displayed as boldface.
br — Line break. (empty)
A line break does not create a new paragraph; it only marks the end of a line.
sub and sup — Subscript and superscript.
Useful for math and chemistry: I have x3+2x2 molecules of H2O.
mark — Highlighting.
Not very often used, but it's kind of cool.
Some of the inline elements you've seen require attributes, extra information besides the name of the element itself. Attributes are written inside the opening tag of the element.

img — Images.
Needs a src attribute with a URL, and an alt attribute with descriptive text.
a — Hyperlinks.
Needs an href attribute with a URL.
Images
The syntax for the img tag is like this:

<img src="Image URL here" alt="A description of the image">
The URL of an image may be an absolute URL, such as http://placebear.com/800/600, or it may be a relative URL such as images/wolves.jpg.

The alt text is used if the image can't be loaded, or if the user can't see images — such as if the user is using a screen reader.

Links
Hyperlinks allow the user to navigate from one page to another. They are created using the a element. The destination of the link is written in an attribute called href; the link text appears as the contents of the a element. Here's an example:

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">
  Wikipedia's "Hypertext" article
</a>
This code produces a link like this: Wikipedia's "Hypertext" article.

A link within a single web site can be written using a relative URL. Links to other sites must be written as absolute URLs.
