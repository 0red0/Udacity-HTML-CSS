And every file that toad would write <br>
It used HTML <br>

/(<br>) is a break tag to make new line

<p>this is a story. Add paragraph tags
  to make it better. </p>
  <p> Once upon a time there was a baby
    tiger named Talia. </p>
    <p> Talia lived in a frearsome jungle
      in the middle of the frearsome
      jungle.</p>
      <p> Talia was the most frearsome of
        all, though she was only a baby.</p>

  <h1>My HTML Notes</h1>
  <p>This page is a collection of my awesome notes about HTML!</p>
  <h2>The Web</h2>
  <p>The Web (or World Wide Web) is a collection of documents and other files. Most of the documents are made using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).</p>
  <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
  <p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. It's used to define the structure or layout of a web page.</p>

<h2>My chemistry notes</h2>
<strong>Molecule name:</strong> <em>Sulfur hexafluride</em><br><br>
<strong>Molecular formula:</strong> C<sub>6</sub>
H<sub>12</sub> O<sub>6</sub><br><br>
<strong>Note:</strong> This gas has a much higher
density than air. Basically the opposite of
helium. <mark>Crazy!</mark><br><br>

  Here is an example of a nested list:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mammals
    <ol>
      <li>Raccoons
      <li>Gorillas
    </ol>

  <li>Riptiles
    <ol>
      <li>Iguanas
      <li>Cobras
    </ol>

  <li>Birds
    <ol>
      <li>Ostriches
      <li>Ravens
    </ol>
</ul>

<p>
  Indentaion can help show the nested structure of
  the elements.
</p>

<p>
  It can also make the code <em>much</em>
  easier to read!

this is a qualified URL also <br>
this file:///user/name/notes.html <br>

(en.wikipedia.org) is the <strong> DOMAIN NAME </strong>
<br><br>

THE TEXT AFTER IS WHAT SHOWS and clicked <br>
